# pyqt-progressbar-table-widget
QProgressBar in each row of QTableWidget to show the progression of multi-thread

I should've used different module to demonstrate multi-threading other than pytube because pytube or any other YouTube related modules tend to be changed a lot. Oh well..

Again, you will see this a lot in my other modules :)

After all using AI with mutiple threads will be really beneficial and necessary.

# Requirements
* PyQt5 >= 5.14
* pytube - for showing the multi-thread progression of downloading youtube videos

## Preview

## TODO
* support single thread function (in order) as well 
* disable the run button when running multi-threads
* running in background
